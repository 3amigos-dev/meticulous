This repository produces semi-automated pull-requests and stamps them with a
reference to this note to be transparent about the automation.

This reference is not intended to be advertising so if you are upset about the
reference please request the comment be updated to remove the reference.

The automation in this repository runs a spell checker over a repository and
highlights a list of potential spelling errors for the user to select and
correct, it then prepares a pull request. The spelling errors have been reviewed
by a human but mistakes can be made. The most frequent mistake is fixing
spelling mistakes in versioned source files from dependent libraries. If this
happens please accept my appologies and if possible feel free to add a comment to
the pull request and close it.
